(Just some notes to figure out which direction to turn when etc.)

for / and \ it depends on which direction you are currently going.

for '/' turn char:

        /--<---           left      turn left        

    -->-/                 right     turn left

        v                 down      turn right
        |
        /

        /                  up       turn right
        |
        ^

for '\' turn char:

        \--<---           left      turn right        

    -->-\                 right     turn right

        v                 down      turn left
        |
        \

        \                  up       turn left
        |
        ^

So this can be simplified a bit, since the rules are kinda grouped...

for '/' char:
  if direction is left or right, turn left
  if direction is up or down, turn right

for '\' char:
  if direction is left or right, turn right
  if direction is up or down, turn left

for intersections, our logic will cycle through which way to turn



SO after we know which way to turn, the only logic left is to implement the 
turn depending on current position. Actually, all we really need to do is 
change the current direction, and then move straight after that.

                         
   char  current dir  |   turn   |  new dir
----------------------|----------|----------
    >      right      |   left   |    up
    >      right      |   right  |   down
    <      left       |   left   |   down
    <      left       |   right  |    up
    ^       up        |   left   |   left
    ^       up        |   right  |   right
    v      down       |   left   |   right
    v      down       |   right  |   left


   char  current dir  |   turn   |  new dir
----------------------|----------|----------
    >      right      |   right  |   down
    <      left       |   right  |    up
    ^       up        |   right  |   right
    v      down       |   right  |   left

    >      right      |   left   |    up
    <      left       |   left   |   down
    ^       up        |   left   |   left
    v      down       |   left   |   right
