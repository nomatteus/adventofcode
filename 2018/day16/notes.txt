Part 1
----------------------------------------

For each of the test cases, we will try all 16 opcodes to see if they would
apply to the given before/after register values, and opcode & input & output.


Part 2
----------------------------------------

Given the list of valid ops for each input from part 1, we need to deduce (map)
the operations to their operation number, so that we can execute the input
correctly. This sounds like it could use a backtracking algorithm, where we try
to find a mapping that satisfies the constraints given.

For backtracking, need a sort of tree structure, where each node contains a partial
solution. At each point, if we find a contradition, then move up to the parent and
try the next option. We can implement this using recursion.
